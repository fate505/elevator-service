# Bluestaq Coding Challenge

This project is the offered implementation for the coding challenge.

It is simulation written completely in JAVA. 
The main framework is Spring Boot and the frontend is Vaadin since javascript was not permitted in the challenge.

The parent maven "elevator" module is a placeholder in case the front end and back-end needed to be seperated. The elevator-service module contains all the relevant code.

Additional assumptions and explanations are available in the javadoc.
